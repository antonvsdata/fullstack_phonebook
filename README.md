## Phonebook app

A simple React application with a REST API, an exercise for the Full Stack Development course offered by University of Helsinki.

The app is deployed on Heroku at https://fathomless-cove-20360.herokuapp.com/ .

Note about exercise 3.22. and ESLint: I use [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) extension on VS Code, which automatically formats my files to take care of any style erros. ESLint is set up to work with Prettier.
